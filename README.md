# ConvexClustering
My research work on robust extensions to convex clustering.


This project relies on matlab to run.
Please check out [Convex Cluster Experiments.ipynb](https://github.com/kevinm36/ConvexClustering/blob/master/Code/Convex Cluster Experiments.ipynb) for the bridging code between python and matlab. 
The [presentation](https://github.com/kevinm36/ConvexClustering/blob/master/Convex_Clustering.pdf) should provide a solid introduction to the topic.
